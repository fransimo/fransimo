I'm passionate about IT, fine arts, photography, cryptocurrencies, NFTs and travel.

I started programming at 11 years (1986). At 17, I was selling software as a freelance.

I began photographing at 7. From the beginning, my intention is to capture the beauty and essence of the landscape (natural, urban or human). My work has been exhibited at Barcelona, New York, For Collins, Miami and Perpignan. My passion for photography leads me to be the curator of various exhibitions and books, president of Barcelona Photobloggers (an amateur photo club), co-founder of Caja Azul (s series of talk and debates for professional photographers) and member of Calle 35 (a street photography collective).

As an artist in the [new media art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art) environment I exploreÂ the relationship between man and technology. Iâ€™m interested in artificial intelligence (especially in relationship with our sense of consciousness and life), the possibilities of open-source/open-hardware, open data banks and the information that users shares by mistake.

As an IT professional, I worked for several multinational companies in Spain. I'm specialised over the years in Python and Airflow to support machine learning projects as an architect, Automated Testing as QA Manager, Configuration and Release Management as processes and for CI/CD. My most valuable skill as an engineer is my ability to speak and listen several _languages_ to glue teams and make things work.
